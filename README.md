I moved the cigarettes out of the way to take this photo

I’m going to quit. It’s a bad habit.

Cigarettes suck the life out of you.

Where I live, people smile back at you. Here nothing.

It’s strange, happiness should be baseline. 

But, instead we feel awkward to express ourselves.

All I'm asking for is a smile :)

To me, Europe is colder; gothic, as if they never grew out of their dark ages.

I thought of a device, a way to actually hack the system.

An innocent, smile on camera sign.

---

## The Sign

The camera needs to protect anonymity.

So I believe it will classify “smile or no smile” on-device. I believe this is possible with current tech.

---

## The distribution

Now, I’ll explain how to distribute it.

1. Using the panopticon effect, people will actually smile when they look at it. _(yay!)_
2. It just says “smile on camera” with [smileindex.org](http://smileindex.org) in small print.
3. The entire sign will be a QR code. You’ll be able to to get the link off the QR code from across the street.

---

## The website

Features on the website.

1. Each sign will have a custom QR code. *(You can pay more to customize the code).*
2. Icon attribution. This device will go viral and will be interesting to see how it spreads.
3. Demographics querying.
4. A list of identified people and their photos.
5. A way to identify yourself.
6. Order a sign for you or someone else.

## Identifying yourself

This is how identifying yourself works.

With the sign’s unique link, you submit a photo of yourself. 

To submit the photo, you have to accept the terms and conditions of the site (very transparent).

Once submitted the device posts a listing to find a relevant face from the last 24 hours. 

Every device will check the public roster for an identity request.
*because you are asking the network to provide a match, this may take some time*

If there’s a match you can claim your identity with your phone number.

Once claimed, you can submit a form to provide more data. There can even be a bounty posted on the sign to provide you money to submit the form. *Can't be abused since it's literally photo verified*.

You can also recieve a portion of profit that the network creates with your data.

### Registration
How to register a client to create queries on the network.

To do this, you receive a text from whatsapp or sms. Then you are provided a short-term link that initially provides a set-cookie with a session key.
  
While the session is active, you can submit public queries.

## Querying the network

For a small fee, you can query the camera. *This revenue can be shared by the owner of the signs.*

This network is completly public. And given this, it is a big concern to keep it safe.

There will be a public ledger that the clients will poll. The ledger contains bounties for queries that people have paid for.

A bounty will have the following characteristics:

1. A question
2. A price
3. Whether it's open or not.
4. Owner (verified phone number)

If a client decides to resolve a bounty it can submit an answer to the network.

By default, the sign will always post two basic bounties (the owner of the sign can always control this).

1. Is someone smileing?
2. Is someone smoking?
